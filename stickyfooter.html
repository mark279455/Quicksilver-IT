                        Every company relies on its critical data - how long would yours last if that data
                        suddenly disappeared? Data storage and backup is central to business continuity. 90% of
                        businesses experience some form of downtime due to inadequate data backup, and some of
                        them will
                        never recover: make sure you're not one of them.
