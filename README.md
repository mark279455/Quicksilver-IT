# Quicksilver IT Site

README.md file for my Code Institutute first project.

![Techsini](documentation/testing/techsini.JPG)

I decided to do a simple design for a company that I used to own.
Quicksilver IT Ltd provided IT support for small businesses in Hertfordshire.

The site is designed to show potential customers what services the company offers, and encourage them to contact the company.

It is hosted on Github here [Quicksilver IT](https://mark279455.github.io/Quicksilver-IT/index.html)

    These also highlight to show which page is currently loaded.

2.  Social Media Icons in the footer that have tooltips to describe them on hover.
    The footer stays at the bottom of all displays all the time.

### Index.html

1.  Three sections that attend to 3 subjects.

    *   A sales section
        This contains a list of problems that the user may have with their current IT Support Company.
        It also has a blinking line telling the user that poor IT Support is costing money.

        As the screen width increases, the font size increases.

    *   A section that describes why Quicksilver IT is different.
        This describes some details about who Quicksilver IT are and how they operate.

        As the screen width increases, these containers change from a column arragement to a step across type display, and at larger screen sizes into 3 columns.

    The header blinks to the user showing the number to telephone, or offers the form.

    The form takes values for the following - all fields are required.

        This option has a textfield for the user to describe their issues.

    *   How did you hear about us - 

        This option gives a dropdown with the following options:

        +   Advertisement
        +   Social media
        +   Word of mouth

    As screen width increases the form increases width and font until 763px wide is reached, when it stays at a set width of 584px wide.

## Deployment

The website has been deployed using Github pages.

on Github, goto settings and then pages.
deploy from branch, main and root.

The site uses relative references, and so deployment in a local environment requires only a web server and a dedicated directory for the project


Version Control
The site was created using the Gitpod and pushed to github to the remote repository ???Quicksilver-IT???.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

git add <file> - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

git commit -m ???commit message??? - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

git push - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

Deployment to Github Pages
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the menu on left select 'Pages'
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Branch: main
Click 'Save'
A live link will be displayed in a green banner when published successfully.
The live link can be found here - https://mark279455.github.io/Quicksilver-IT/index.html

Clone the Repository Code Locally
Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to clone to use locally:

Click on the code drop down button
Click on HTTPS

Open your IDE of choice (git must be installed for the next steps)
Type git clone copied-git-url into the IDE terminal

## Tests 

Tests were done on all links on all pages - namely the navigation system.

the Home, Services and Contact tabs in the header point to the index.html, services.html and contactus.html respectively.
The Quicksilver IT logo in the top left of each page also redirects to the home page.

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 320px and upwards as defined in [WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera browsers.


Validation
The three html files were validated successfully by the W3C validator.

* [Index Page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https://mark279455.github.io/Quicksilver-IT/index.html)

* [Services Page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https://mark279455.github.io/Quicksilver-IT/services.html)

* [Contact us Page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https://mark279455.github.io/Quicksilver-IT/contactus.html)

* [Styles.css](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https://mark279455.github.io/Quicksilver-IT/assets/css/styles.css)

The site was verified by the W3.org CSS Validator page as well.

## Lighthouse

Lighthouse initially gave slower results than required. Images on the site were converted from .jpg to to .webp format, this successfully improved the loading times and raised the Lighthouse scores to be all over 90%.

services.html

![WAVE-SERVICES](documentation/testing/wave-services.jpg)

contactus.html

![WAVE-CONTACTUS](documentation/testing/wave-contactus.jpg)

Wave produced a report showing 2 alerts on each page. This alert was in the header which is common to all pages.

![WAVE-ALERT](documentation/testing/wave-redundant-in-header.jpg)

![WAVE2](documentation/testing/wave2.jpg)

These alerts related to a duplicated link in the header - which was a design choice.

## Bugs

The form on the contactus page does not check that the input for number of computers is negative. For this to work, javascript would be required.
